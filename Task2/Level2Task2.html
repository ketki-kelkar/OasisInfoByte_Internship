            <p class="font">
			Stephen Hawking, a renowned English theoretical physicist, left an indelible mark on the world of science with his groundbreaking contributions. Born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England, he pursued his studies at the University of Oxford and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1966. Despite being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the early 1960s, a condition that gradually immobilized him, Hawking displayed extraordinary determination, continuing his work in the realm of theoretical physics.
            <br><br><br>Hawking's pioneering work primarily centered on the profound complexities of general relativity and black holes. In 1971, he proposed the existence of mini black holes, compact yet massively dense objects governed by both relativity and quantum mechanics. One of his most notable contributions came in 1974, when he theorized that black holes emit subatomic particles, eventually leading to their evaporation. This groundbreaking insight bridged classical thermodynamics and quantum mechanics, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe's fundamental principles. His remarkable achievements earned him prestigious accolades, including fellowships from the Royal Society, the Lucasian professorship of mathematics at Cambridge once held by Isaac Newton, and notable honors like the Copley Medal and the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom. Through his seminal works, such as "A Brief History of Time" and "The Grand Design," coauthored with Leonard Mlodinow, Stephen Hawking's legacy continues to inspire generations and expand the horizons of human knowledge.
